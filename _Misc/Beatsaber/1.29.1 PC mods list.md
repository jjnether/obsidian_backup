Note:
- First install beatsaber version with BSLegacyLauncher
- Ensure Steam and Oculus are running on the PC, then link quest with oculus link
- Run Beatsaber with BSLegacyLauncher (oculus mode)
- Before modding, run a level once
- Will need to point mod assistant to the file directory for the version install
- For NalulunaMenu .ogg files, youtube to .ogg webpages may not work, so try youtube to mp3, then use audacity to export the mp3 to .ogg
- For HitScoreVisualizer, copy over Colored Numbers.json to \UserData\HitScoreVisualizer, then select it in game - go to github page for further customization
- Use BeatSyncConsole to sync bookmarks to PC (if new install, run once to generate config files, then reference old config files for settings) (https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSync)
- For BeatSync, if using BSLegacyLauncher, will need to allow it to find the steam version first, then exit and modify the BeatSyncConsole.json file under configs directory
	- In config file, replace beatsaber file path with the correct one e.g. "GameDirectory": "C:\\Users\\Josiah\\Downloads\\Beatsaber\\BSLegacyLauncher\\Installed Versions\\Beat Saber 1.21.0"
- For playlist editing:
	- You can use PlaylistSaber to see what songs aren't sorted into playlists
	- You can launch beatsaber in desktop mode to control with a mouse and monitor
	- You can manually edit playlist files and delete song directories (use search functions to find song)
- Do the following for adding friends to the scoresaber page (it seems that the scoresaber profile is linked to the steam account using it when playing on PC, so this may be unnecessary)
	- Sidequest, :fileexplorer:, Moddata/com.beatgames.beatsaber/mods/scoresaber save the friends.txt file
	- Grab the scoresaber ID of the person you want added and add it to the list in that file 
	- Then upload the new file to the place you got it from
- In SaberTailor, for scaling, will need to enable in mod menu or in .json config file in userdata (IsSaberScaleModEnabled)
- (It seems that) .json and .bplist playlist file extensions are interchangeable
