Nice job editing! A few tips and things to keep in mind. @editor also good for you to look over and watch out for
- Make sure you have proper merging between sections using keywords, and keywords are bolded and capitalized
	- every section in a block of dialogue should be routed somewhere (merge, end dialogue, or back to options/root)
- No use of "default" "stays on option" in imp notes, you have to specify the condition
- Make sure objectives use the correct format
- Be sure that the PC always has an option (to decline a quest for instance), and make sure you consider if/how the PC would talk to the quest giver to possibly accept the quest
- Make sure to specify actions in PC dialogue if needed
	- For instance, if dialogue choice will result in combat, dialogue option should have (Attack) at the end
- Remember that VA notes use brackets
- Be sure to follow the `QUEST NOTATION` section of the style guide
- Be sure to double check for extra spaces at the end of the line (use the find feature with regular expressions)


Questions:
- There needs to be one more condition for if ASA is completed, but not DT?
- Is it fair that if PC declines so strongly, he won't get another chance at this quest? If not, who should PC approach to get the quest again?
- The book must remain in Cyrodiil in order to retain its living connection to Garlas Agea. The ties would be severed. I cannot allow that to happen.
