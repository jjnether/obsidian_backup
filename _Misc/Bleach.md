- **Skip** Filler Episode 50
- **Watch** Episodes 51-63
- **Skip** Filler Episodes 64-109 - _The Bount & The Assault Arcs_ 
    - Here is where the excessive fillers start, creating lots of inconsistencies and leaving you wondering if the creators ever watched the show they are writing about? LoL
    - Not only create inconsistencies, but they also spoil the next arc, as they basically steal the same plot.
    - You can safely ignore all characters you don't recognize in the next Arrancar Arc, they are remnants of this filler arc and you can ignore any references to this adventure.
- **Watch** Episodes 110-127 - _The Arrancar_
- **Skip** Filler Episodes 128-137
- **Watch** Episodes 138-146 - _The Arrancar Part 2: The Hueco Mundo Sneak Entry_
- **Watch** Filler Episodes 147-149 - _[Ashido Kanō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Soul_Reapers_in_Bleach#Ashido_Kan%C5%8D) Mini-Arc_
    - "Although episodes focused on the character Ashido Kanō were not featured in the manga due to timing issues, [Kubo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tite_Kubo) still helped the anime staff to show them in the anime" [-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(season_7)).
    - It's best to watch these fillers for the continuation of the story; they are quite interesting in the plot and show the underground of Hueco Mundo.

- **Skip** Filler Episodes 213-214
- **Watch** Episodes 215-226 - _The Arrancar Part 5: Battle in Karakura_
    - This arc is not so good, in part due to having some filler mixed in between the fights, so skip as needed. You won't be missing anything important if you skip within the episodes or even a few episodes as the main fights start around episode 225.
- **Skip** Filler Episodes 227-229
- **Skip** Filler Episodes 230-255 - _Zanpakutō: The Alternate Tale_
    - This arc, although filler, is quite entertaining with an interesting plot, probably the only filler arc worth watching, **although I recommend watching it at the end of the series,** so you don't stop the pacing of the main story. It can fit anywhere in the timeline. It does break apart some of the notions of how this world works regarding the _Zanpakutō_
- **Skip** Filler Episodes 256-266 - Continuation of the _Zanpakutō: The Alternate Tale_ Arc
    - These are worthless episodes after the main filler story. I guess they just needed more time before they continued with the canon
- **Watch** Episodes 267-283 - _The Arrancar Part 6: Fall of the Espada_
- **Optional** Filler Episode 284
    - This is the backstory of the Arrancar from the previous episode. I found it interesting, but it's not super great either. It does adds a little more depth to what happened earlier, but it adds nothing to the main story.

- **Watch** Episodes 343-346 - _The Lost Agent (Fullbring)_
- **Watch** Filler Episode 347
    - Although it is marked as a filler, is best to watch it for the continuation of the story and it gives more depth to Ichigo's decision.
- **Watch** Episodes 348-350
- **Optional** Filler Episode 351
    - This episode has the filler mixed in with the canon, so it may be best to watch it for continuity and skip the comedic relief as need it within the episode.
    - However, the next episode just ignores a lot of what happened and repeats what's necessary for the story, so it's not essential to the plot.
- **Watch** Episodes 352-354
- **Skip** Filler Episode 355
- **Watch** Episode 356
- **Watch** Filler Episode 357
    - Another filler that is best to watch for the continuity of the story.
