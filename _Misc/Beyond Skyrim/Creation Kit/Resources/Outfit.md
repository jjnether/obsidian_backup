An Outfit is essentially a specialized Form List which can only contain [Armor](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Armor "Armor").

## Use

Outfits are what Actors use to decide what to wear. [Actors](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Actors "Actors") are assigned an Outfit on the [Inventory tab](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Inventory_Tab "Inventory Tab") of the Actor dialogue. You can add specific Armor to the list by clicking and dragging from the [Object Window](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Object_Window "Object Window"). You can also choose [Leveled Items](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/LeveledItem "LeveledItem") if you want the Actor to have randomly-selected Armor based on the player's Level. To remove items from an outfit, select the item you wish to remove and press the delete key.

An actor's outfit can be changed using the [SetOutfit](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/SetOutfit_-_Actor "SetOutfit - Actor") script command.
