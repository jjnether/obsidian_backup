The Render Window is the panel in which you manipulate the 3d spaces in the game. If you are running the Creation Kit for the first time it will be on the right hand side as seen in the image below.

The Render Window is initially blank until you have loaded a [Cell](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Cell "Cell") or [[World Spaces|Worldspace]]  that you are going to manipulate. Cells can be selected in the [[Cell View Window]] panel. Objects can be dragged into the Render Window from the [[Object Window]], creating a [Reference](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Reference "Reference") of that object in the cell that can now be manipulated.

-   More information on the basics of the Render Window can be found in the **[Tutorials](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Tutorials "Tutorials")** section.
-   The **[Creation Kit Keyboard Mapping](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Creation_Kit_Keyboard_Mapping "Creation Kit Keyboard Mapping")** page has a list of all the controls and a printable quick sheet.

## Camera Navigation

-   Mouse wheel up/down: **Zoom** the camera in/out.
-   Shift + mouse movement: **Rotate** the camera around the currently selected object (or around center of cell if nothing selected yet).
-   Spacebar + mouse movement, _or_ middle mouse button + mouse movement: **Pan** the camera sideways or up/down.
-   Right mouse button: **Options**, including Render Window Properties, with camera control options, such as zoom/rotate/pan **speed**. You may need to adjust this frequently, since a speed good for an overview of a city is unworkable for examining a face, and vice versa).
