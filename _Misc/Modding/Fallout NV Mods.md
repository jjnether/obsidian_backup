Fallout New Vegas ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated



NOTE: 
- Mods by Qolore7 will be good because he made the viva new vegas guide
- For archive invalidation:
  - Install it with Mod Manager of choice or manually. Go to your Fallout New Vegas Folder, open Data folder, Fallout New Vegas ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated!.exe should be located there if you installed it correctly. 
  - Launch it and wait for a "Warning" that application was unable to locate Fallout_default.ini - if you got the warning it means that mod works fine, you just need to find location of your Fallout_default.ini file. It's located in Fallout New Vegas Folder.
  - After that, window from mod should pop up, click activate and close the app. And that's it, never need to play with it again (unless you reinstall the game ofc).
