- Can remove time from compass by going to main and pause menus overhaul (n) > HUD menu > Game Time
- If sprint key (L-shift) is only slowing you down, rebind the in-game hotkey for sprint to something else, then try to use L-shift to sprint again (actual sprint key is controlled by Enhanced Movement mod)

TTW Ultimate Invisible Wall Remover MAY break scripted events if quest related areas are entered from the incorrect route

but is otherwise a MASSIVE quality of life improvement.

Instant and Faster Pipboy (No Stutter)
	The female version has built in realignment, which fixes the tilt that could sometimes occur when opening the Pip-Boy. Some Pip-Boy replacers ALREADY
	realign the Pip-Boy,causing this effect to compound. If this happens to you, try the regular (non-female) version instead.

Charisma Tweaks (NVSE)
	Many skill checks, including speech checks, will display DIFFERENT skill values than your actual skill, because charisma is now imparting a multiplier on the skill check.

Sweet Consumables

 Energy Visuals Plus 2.0 - NV and TTW
	This mod is linked to some significant increases in crashing. It doesn’t seem to directly be the mod at fault, but rather something in one of the Script Extender functions it utilizes. I recommend testing this with some form of energy weapon while in god mode in a heavily populated area. If you don’t crash, you’re probably good to go.
