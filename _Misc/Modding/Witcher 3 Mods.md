SCRIPT MERGER NOTE:
 - If different mods want to edit the same lines, copy and paste the lines from the mods and combine them both in the output text on the bottom half of the screen within script merger

BUGS:
- If game will start but immediately minimizes, go to user.settings in "Documents\The Witcher 3" and change to FullScreenMode = 1
- If NPC faces look melted:
	- Open your user.settings located in C:\Users\Holgar96\documents\The Witcher 3
	- Find and modify "MeshLODDistanceScale" with the value 10 or 2. (i have MeshLODDistanceScale=10)
	
	Remember that changing that value stops NPC’s from blinking/moving their lips, there’s a mod that tries to fix that ... (Lip Movement and HiRes Shadows on NPCs in gameplay) https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1902
