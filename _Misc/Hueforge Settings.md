- Set your Top Thickness to 0.  It can be 3-4 layers, but the default 0.8mm thickness HUGELY increases slicing time
- Most of us do 1 perimeter, 999 bottom layers and 2-3 top layers with 0 Top Thickness
- For a nice, thick print, do 0.48 min depth and set the bottom three layers to 0.16mm and then 0.04 from there. Saves about 30 minutes
	- the first 3 layers do height of .16 and then drop to .04 with base layer .16 with a height range modifier on the model
- Ensure vertical shell thickness - This setting adds extra infill along sloping walls to prevent gaps from being visible, CPU intensive to calculate and entirely unnecessary because we're printing at 100% infill 
- Detect overhang perimeters/Slow down for overhangs - Another CPU intensive setting that shouldn't be necessary at all since HueForge shouldn't be creating any overhangs
- Reduce infill retraction - Another CPU intensive setting which can result in visible scarring over solid infill regions, this should be turned off for HueForge prints regardless of the CPU impact imo
