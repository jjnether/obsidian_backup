- Antifederalists worried that there was no way to remove judges, so not only were they unelected, but also unaccountable (there for life)
- Federalist 78 (federalist papers)

- Argued the court was the weakest of the three branches
- Courts have "no influence over neither the sword or the purse"
- "It may truly be said to have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgement

Why is the SC important?

- Because it decides if laws passed by congress (and the states) are compatible with the constitution
- It does this through judicial review

- Marbury v. Madison (1803)

- Marshall asked 3 questions:

- Does Marbury have the right to the commission? - yes
- Do the laws of the US afford him a remedy? - yes
- Is the appropriate remedy a writ of mandamus issued by the SC? - no

- This write is a note saying you must do this

- He found that issuing writs of mandamus is absent from SC's jurisdiction

- Marbury was in the wrong court

- Marshall declared that when a law and the constitution contradict, the constitution wins every time

- Over time, the SC's exercise of judicial review has varied significantly

- During first era of judicial review, the SC's most significant cases dealt with unresolved jurisdictional boundaries between the national and state governments

- McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)

- For the court, Marshall wrote "the power to tax involves the power to destroy" (congress has right to regulate interstate commerce)
- The necessary and proper clause gives congress the broad authority to use "all means which are appropriate" to carry out its explicitly enumerated powers

- Dred Scott v. Sandford and States' Rights

- Roger B. Taney, appointed by Andrew Jackson to succeed John Marshall, moved the SC away from the national supremacy doctrine
- The court's Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) ruling brought the coutnry perilously close to civil war

- Second era is marked by the federal government's regulation of the economy

- The court found itself as the arbiter of politically charged regulatory policy
- The primacy of property rights

- Following the civil war, the SC, for the most part, sided with idea that property equated with liberty

- The court found work-hour regulations unconstitutional in Lochner v. New York (1905)

- Substantive due process, right to contract
- This, the era became known as the Lochner era

- During the 1920's, the court developed a pattern of ruling against state laws regulating business
- From 1934 to 1937, the court voted against a dozen laws created ruing FDR's first term, for example, regulating child labor and providing mortgage relief
- Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937

- The switch in time that saved nine
- West Coast Hotel Co. v Parrish

- Ended Lochner era
- Over turned Adkins v Children's Hospital (1923)

- Originally said there should be no federal minimum wage

- As justices retired/died, FDR was able to get his way
- Wickard v Filburn (1942)

- The third era of judicial review began convincingly in the 1940's

- Various reasons may account for the new focus:

- Most cases on regulating interstate commerce had been decided
- Civil rights and liberties cases provided opportunites to move from questions of separation of powers to questions about individuals, thus allowing more room for interpretation.
- The door opened when the court incorporated free speech rights via the 14th amendment
- Rights of the criminally accused made it on the docket
- NAACP challenged segregation and disenfranchisement in the federal courts

- Fourth era?

- Reasserting Judicial review and a return to states' rights
- US v lopez (1995)

- Law on handguns in school zones

- US v Morrison (2000)

- Violence Against women act of 1993

- The Robert's court continued the Rehnquist Court's direction of limiting the federal governments power under the commerce clause
- The patient Protection and affordable health care act of 2010 was upheld under congress's power to tax

The Structure of the Federal Judiciary

- Federal Courts

- Limited jurisdiction

- Authorized 2 types of cases:

- Those concerning federal questions
- Those involving citizens of different states

- Lowest is District Courts

- 94 district courts with each state having at least 1

- Middle is Circuit Courts of Appeals

- 12 in geographic regions (circuits)
- One in DC

- Highest is Supreme Court

- Court of final appeal
- Decides less than 100 cases annually, which is 1% of the appeals it receives

- Litigants must file a writ of certiorari, requesting the SC order the lower court to send it the records of the trial
- Rule of four: four justices must agree to hear a case for a certiorari petition to be granted
- Up to four law clerks assist each justice

- How do they pick cases?

- One of the parties is the US
- Justices identify cases that will resolve ambiguities and conflicting lower-court decisions
- Taking cues from others
- Interested groups not party to the case may file amicus curiae briefs

- Friend of the court brief - details legal arguments behind the case
- Especially if one of the amicus briefs is from the US

- How does case get argued?

- Half hour of oral hearing before Court (for each side)
- Justices vote and decide who writes opinions

- Have 3 possible decisions:

- Affirm lower court decision
- Reverse lower court decision
- Remand the case - 'do over'

- Every SC decision contains two elements essential to creating doctrine:

- The vote that decides the case in favor of one of the parties
- The opinion, a statement or set of statements in which the majority explains the rationale for its decision in such a way as to create doctrine (make policy)

- How do justices decide?

- Doctrine of Stare Decisis

- Follow past precedents

- Promotes certainty in the law
- Has overruled itself less than 120 times in the history of the court
- "an erroneous decision can and should be overturned, no matter how old it is"
- Judicial restraint v. activism

- How willing should the SC be to overturn the actions of other branches of governments?
- Does not equal conservative v liberal

- Scalia - reasonable evaluation of the text of a law and the constitution

- Living constitution - the constitution is a flexible document that can evolve to address new circumstances

- Breyer

- The SC's place in separation of powers

- Judicial review seems to give the court the last word on much of public policy
- The court faces formidable obstacles when its policy preferences differ sharply from those of congress and the president
- Absence of judicial enforcement

- As the supreme court has no enforcement power, congress and the president can ignore its rulings
- "John Marshall had made his decision; now let him enforce it"

- Worcester v Georgia (1832)

- Senate confirmation

- The senate judiciary committee schedules confirmation hearings and makes recommendation to the full chamber

- Judges appointed by democratic presidents tend to liberal and those appointed by republican presidents tend to be conservative

- Who guards the guardians?

- How appropriate is it that unelected, life-tenured judges can decide on the constitutionality of acts of congress?

- It violates the republican principles of majority rule
- It meets the framer's broader concerns for balanced political system
- But, who guards the guardians?

- There are limitation son judicial review

- Lack of enforcement power
- Constitutional limits
- Ways that congress and the president can redirect judicial doctrine

- The federal judiciary in national policymaking
