Theory and Practice

Development of the Presidency

Constitutional presidency

- Executive power includes only enumerated or delegated powers
- No inherent powers

Constitutional powers of the president

- Article 2:

- Clause 2:

- command of military
- Opinions of cabinet secretaries
- Pardons

- Clause 3:

- The take care clause (takes care that the laws are executed)

Stewardship

- Anything that is not forbidden by the constitution or statute (law)
- Teddy Roosevelt

What was left out - administrative controls

- Instead the constitution allowed congress to establish the role of the president
- The constitution leaves ambiguity on key aspects of separation of powers, specifically between congress and the presidency

Presidential power vs. Presidential authority

- The difference

- Authority is the acknowledged right to make a popular decision
- Power is the ability to get stuff done

- Power doesn't come from the constitution, authority does
- Richard E. Neustadt's "Presidential Power and the modern presidents"

- President as 'clerk'

- Shared powers, not separated
- The president is only one of several masters of the bureaucracy
- People in all positions (including the president) cannot do much without persuading others to help them

- President is in a great position, because he is able to help more people and everybody wants something from the president
- This gives him bargaining power
- "presidential power is the power to persuade"
- "the power to persuade is the power to bargain"

- Persuasion not command
- When the president resorts to commanding, it is a sign of weakness
- "The essence of a president's persuasive task is to convince such men that what the white house wants of them is what they ought to do for their sake and on their authority"

Effective influence/President's source of power

- Bargaining powers that come from the position
- Status, authority, and powers (veto, appointments, budgeting)

Professional reputation

- The Washington community must be convinced that he has both the skill and the will to use his political advantage
- If a president cannot convince others that he will inevitably win, at least he needs to convince them that it will be costly to cross him
- You can't punish everyone, but you need to selectively punish your enemies and reward your allies

Public prestige

- The president's popular support outside Washington

Four spheres of the modern presidency's leadership

- Commander in chief and head of state

- Commander in chief

- The framers inserted a "check" on the president as commander in chief

- Only congress can declare war

- Presidents respond by making the first move and setting congress up to agree
- War Powers resolution (1973)

- In response to Vietnam
- Notify Congress within 48 hours of committing American Forces
- Forbids forces remaining more than 60 days (with a 30 day withdrawal period) without consent of Congress
- Passed over presidential veto
- Invasion of Grenada (didn't ask)
- Bombing of Libya (didn't ask)
- Invasion of Panama (no vote)
- Gulf War 1 (asked for and received join resolution authorizing Iraqi conflict)
- Somalia (said no congressional approval needed cause humanitarian mission)
- Haiti (congress tried to force the president to get authorization, senate voted 100-0)
- Kosovo (claimed had NATO approval)
- Afghanistan (Granted "all necessary and appropriate force")
- Iraq War (authorization for use of military force against Iraq resolution of 2002)
- Libya ("not full blown hostilities")
- Abe Lincoln

- Shortly after the Civil War starts, Lincoln suspends habeas corpus
- SC ruled this unconstitutional
- Lincoln ignored and insisted on his constitutional right under (habeas corpus not be suspended unless in case of rebellion or invasion of public safety may require it)

- Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964)

- Like granny's Nightshirt

- "to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force"

- Head of State

- Chief public representative
- Exercises political powers specified in the constitution
- Acts as leader of the country
- The most important constitutional limitation on the president's leadership in foreign affairs is the requirement that a two-thirds majority of the senate ratify treaties
- Executive Agreements:

- An agreement between the president and one or more other countries
- Similar to a treaty, but does not require the approval of Senate

- Chief executive

- Responsible for supervising the bureaucracy
- Executive privilege

- The president's right to withhold information from congress and the courts
- Presidents assert that it's necessary to maintain separation of powers among the branches of government
- Origins: Washington and Jefferson
- US v. Nixon (1974)

- SC has the final voice in determining constitutional questions; no person, not even president, is above the law; and the president can't use executive privilege as an excuse to withhold evidence that is 'demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial'

- Executive orders

- A presidential directive to an executive agency establishing new policies or indicating how an existing policy is to be carried out
- Most executive orders arise from the authority and responsibilities explicitly delegated to the president by law

- Administrator

- As the national government grew, so did obligations of government, strain on congress' time and resources resulted in delegating to the white house a share of the administration
- Delegation

- congress shares law making powers with the government
- Congress can choose the amount of rulemaking authority to delegate to the president
- Too much - congress looses control - can alter policy direction
- Congress may "pass the buck" when policies might have politically unattractive outcomes in order to avoid blame
- Principal-agent problems

- Agency loss is the discrepancy between what principals would ideally like their agents to do and how these agents actually behave
- Principal is congress, agent is president

- Possible problems

- One must monitor agents' performance to ensure that they are vigorously pursuing the tasks delegated
- Agent may shift policy in an undesirable direction
- When that agent is the president, it is difficult to "fire" the agent
- Difficult when the president chooses to administer a program in a direction different from congress' intent

- Budgeting

- The formulation and presentation of the annual budget to congress is one of the president's most important clerical tasks
- Offers presidents an opportunity to set the spending priorities of the federal government
- The president's annual budget, submitted to congress on the first Monday in February, takes months of work
- Assembling and negotiating requests from agencies
- Bringing them into conformity with white house policy goals
- The budget sometimes sails through; other years replaced with "congressional" budget
- Provides congress with valuable technical and political information
- Represents the president's "opening bid" on how much will be spent for what and where the money will come from
- Provides congressional committee with economic forecasts, projected tax revenues, baseline spending estimates for each department broken down by program, and so on

- Chief legislator

- The constitution gives presidents only a modest role in the legislative arena
- May call congress into special session
- May veto laws (article I)
- Must report "from time to time" to congress with state of the union address
- Yet modern presidents attempt to direct American policy by promoting a legislative agenda

- Begin with their party allies in congress
- Mutual accommodation requires effort, but the incentives for partisans in congress and the white house to cooperate are powerful
- No incentives to cooperate are present in the president's relations with legislators of the opposition party

- Presidential success means a potential debit to their (the opposition party) vote count in the next election
- Different electoral calendars affect support and timing for presidential initiatives

- Presidential veto

- Perhaps the president's most formidable tool in dealing with congress
- Allows the president to block congressional action, but does not allow the president to substitute his own policy preferences
- Not a line item veto

- Unified vs Divided control of government

- When presidents find their party in majority control of the house and senate, they have excellent prospects for passing their legislative agenda

- New deal - occurred in the early 1930's as president Franklin Roosevelt and congressional deomcrats sought to ameliorate the great depression
- Great Society - president Lyndon Johnson's anti-poverty programs of the 1960's

- However, during divided government, the president confronts majorities with different preferences
- Gridlock: in politics, gridlock refers to difficulty of passing laws and fulfilling a party's political agenda in a legislature

- Going public

- Intense public relations to promote policies directly to voters circumventing elected officials
- "bully pulpit"
- Fireside chats, state of the union
- Kernell: violates bargaining; undermines elected officials

- Dual presidency
- More freedom internationally than domestically
