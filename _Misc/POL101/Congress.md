National politics in Congressional elections

- National forces have always been a component of congressional election politics and are still important

- In general, congressional candidates are advantaged when their presidential candidate wins
- Today, presidential coattails have far less reach than they did a century ago, but they are still significant

- In midterm elections, the president's party almost always loses congressional seats, but the size of its losses depends in part on the performance of the national economy and the president
- Losses are fewer if the economy is strong and the president is popular
- In 2010, high unemployment, public dissatisfaction with the direction of the economy, and Barack Obama's mediocre approval ratings cost the democrats 64 house and 6 senate seats
- Candidate cannot always disassociate themselves from their party's fate, so they retain a personal stake in their party's public image as well as the public standing of the president

Organizing Congress

- It's extremely difficult for a large representative assembly to formulate, enact, and implement laws

- Use a combination of:

- Leadership
- Political parties
- Committee system
- Rules and institutions

- Collective action problem

- How can leaders mobilize a majority to pass a bill when it is in the interest of most lawmakers to do nothing and free ride?

- Principle agent model

- Rank and file members (principals) delegate certain powers to party leaders (agents) to act in a way that enhances the principle desire to make good policy, win reelection, and maintain (or gain) majority status
- Agents only have power so long as principals desire them to

What do party leaders do?

- Institutional maintenance
- Organization of chamber
- Scheduling floor business
- Agenda setting
- Party maintenance
- Organize party
- Promote party unity
- Help with campaigns

Conditional party governance

- Aldrich & Rhode (1997, 98)
- When:

- Rank and file members share policy views
- Confront an opposition with sharply different view

- Strong centralized leadership arises

Pivotal voter theory

- Krehbiel (1998)
- Policy outcomes rarely diverge from what is acceptable to pivotal voter; leaders cannot skew legislative outcomes

Committee System

- Division of labor
- Its not possible for each member to become an expert on every subject that comes before congress
- Committees allow representatives to become experts in a particular area

Types of committee

- The standing committees of the house and senate - those that exist from one congress to the next unless disbanded - embody congress's division of legislative labor
- They have fixed jurisdictions and stable memberships, which facilitates specialization
- A member in good standing cannot be forced off a standing committee unless his or her party suffers large electoral losses; party ration determines the partisan makeup of committees
- Members, however, can leave committees - generally for a position on a committee considered more important and influential such as money committees
- Least desirable committee assignment: any dealing with the internal administration of congress - particularly members' ethics
- Most committees are divided into subcommittees
- Many have fixed jurisdictions and stable memberships as well
- Encourage specialization and reward members who develop expertise with special influence over their own small pieces of legislative turf
- Have staffs of experts to help them

Conference committees

- Appointed to resolve differences between the house and the senate

Money committees

- Power of the purse had inspired the most contentions jurisdictional fights
- In the earliest years of government, revenue and spending bills were handled by Ways and Means in the house and Finance in the senate
- Today legislative spending is a two-step process in each chamber
- In step on, the committee with jurisdiction over a program authorizes expenditures for it
- In step two, the Appropriations Committee appropriates the money - that is, it writes a bill designating that specific sums be spent on authorized programs

Making laws

- Congress's rules and structures - the parties and committee systems - are designed to enable majorities to make laws
- The lawmaking process, however, presents opponents of a bill with many opportunities to sidetrack or kill legislation

Procedural rules in the senate

- There is no limit on how long senators can talk or how many amendments they can offer
- Individuals or small groups can even filibuster

- Here they hold the floor making endless speeches so that no action can be taken on a bill or anything else. These are difficult to break

- The senate requires 3/5's of the senate (60 votes) to invoke cloture, which allows an additional 30 hours of debate on a bill before a vote is finally taken

- Even the threat of a filibuster can be a potent tool
- More routine today

Congress and electoral politics

- The modern congress is organized to serve the goals of its members

- Primary goal: keep their jobs
- Thus a career in congress depends on getting elected and reelected again and again

The advantages of incumbency

- The decline in party loyalty among voters offered incumbents a chance to win votes that once would have gone routinely to the other party's candidate

- When they realized their advantage, they sought to increase it by voting to give themselves greater resources for servicing their districts
- More money for staff, travel, local offices, and communications

- Important question: If incumbency is so advantageous and if members of congress win reelections so consistently, usually by comfortable margins, who do electoral worries do so much to shape congressional life?

- Answer: the incumbency advantage does not accrue automatically; it stems from diligent use of the many resources that come with holding office

- Richard Fenno

- "Home style" (1978)
- 3 primary objectives:

- Get reelected
- Gain power in congress
- Produce good public policy

- Constituencies as concentric circles of supporters

- Geographic - legal boundaries of district
- Reelection - constituents whom MC feel are likely to vote for him or her
- Primary - loyalists who support the MC consistently
- Personal - inner circle

- Constituent Service

- Decisions on legislative issues are shaped by the potential need to explain and defend them
- Most members spend time at home, keeping in touch and staying visible
- Solicit and process casework

- Requests for information and help in dealing with governmental agencies

- David Mayhew

- "Congress: The electoral connection" (1974)
- Are congressmen in a position to do anything about getting reelected?
- Are they able to affect national partisan percentages?
- Are they able to affect the percentages in their own primary and general election?

- yes

- What is a "safe" congressman?
- Are there any "safe seats" in congress?

- No

- "Whether they are safe or marginal, cautious or audacious, congressmen must constantly engage in activities related to reelection"
- Three activities related to reelection

- Advertising

- Newsletters
- District offices
- Local TV
- Local events
- Brand name
- "To be perceived at all is to be perceived favorable"

- Credit claiming

- Emphasis on individual accomplishment
- Where can credit be found?
- Particularized benefits (specific projects and problems)

- Gravina island bridge

- Nonparticularized benefits

- Casework

- Position taking

- Strategies: conservative or innovative
- Roll call votes
- Floor addresses
- Speeches at home

- "If a group of planners sat down and tried to design a pair of American national assemblies with the goal of serving members' reelection needs year in and year out, they would be hard pressed to improve on what exists"

-moving on

- Although senators engage in many of the same constituency-building activities, they have not been as successful in keeping their jobs
- Three times more likely to lose their seats than house incumbents
- Why?

- States more populous and diverse than congressional districts - most senators unable to develop the personal ties to constituents that house members do
- States, more than districts, have balanced party competition
- Senate races attract more experienced, politically talented, well-financed challengers
- States have media markets that make it easier for challengers to get their message out
- Senators more readily associated with controversial and divisive issues

Are members of congress responsible?

- Electoral logic induces members to promote narrowly targeted programs, projects, or tax breaks for constituents without worrying about the impacts of such measures on spending or revenues

- Called pork barrel legislation

- Gratitude is seen at election time
- We see the manifestation of this logic in behavior such as logrolling
- The legislative practice in which members of congress agree to reciprocally support each other's vote-gaining projects or tax breaks
- Can produce a prisoner's dilemma
- 2010 revolt by voters against collective irresponsibility impacted democrats with substantial losses
- Republicans pledged to abstain from earmakrs as well as other pledges in response to the public's outcries

Fenno paradox

- Congress isn't popular, but congressmen keep getting reelected
