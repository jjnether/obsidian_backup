Systems of government

- Unitary

- system in which the national government creates sub-national governments and gives them what power it wishes. Sub-national governments have no independent authority (UK, Japan, Denmark, France)

- Confederal

- system in which the central government has only those powers given to it by the sub-national government (Belgium, UN, EU, Confederacy)

- Federal

- system in which authority is divided between two or more distinct levels of government (federal and states in US)

- Dillon's Rule - local governments are "creatures of the state"
- Conditions for federalism

- Same people and territory are included in both levels of government

- The nation's constitution protects units at each level of government from encroachment by the other units (independence)
- Each unit is in a position to exert some leverage over the other (Mutual Influence)

The Carrot: Federal grants to the states

- Grant-in-aid

- Funds given by congress to state or local governments for a specific purpose. These grants allow the national government to define these state programs

- Categorical Grant

- A federal grant of money to states or localities for a specific purpose. These grants usually require states to provide matching funds and to adhere to federal guidelines in spending the money

- Block Grant

- Broad grants of money given by the federal government to state governments
- The grants specify the general area (such as education or health services) in which the funds may be spent but leave it to the states to determine the specific allocations set sum of money
- … if not all spent, remains in federal treasure… states have little incentive to curb costs

The Stick

- Federal government uses four basic methods to prescribe state policy and supervise its administration

- Cross-cutting requirements

- Statutes that apply certain rules and guidelines to a broad array of federally subsidized state programs

- Crossover Sanctions

- Stipulations that a state, to remain eligible for full federal funding for one program, must adhere to the guidelines of an unrelated program
- Congress's stipulation that federal highway funds be tied to state adoption of a minimum drinking age of twenty-one

- Direct orders

- Are requirements that can be enforced by legal and civil penalties

- Partial preemption

- Allows the states to administer joint federal-state programs so long as they conform to federal guidelines
- If an agency fails to follow the instructions of the federal agencies, the state might lose control of the program
