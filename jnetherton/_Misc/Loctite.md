Red - LOCTITE® red threadlocker is the highest strength of threadlocker adhesive. This product cures fully in 24 hours and is available in both a liquid and as a semisolid anaerobic. The red high strength threadlocker products are so powerful they may require heat to be disassembled. A primerless grade red threadlocker is also available.



Green - LOCTITE® green threadlocker is recommended for locking preassembled fasteners, e.g. electrical connectors and set screws, and prevents against loosening, rust, and corrosion. This wicking grade threadlocker is categorized as a medium-to-high-strength adhesive. Also available in a liquid form, LOCTITE® green wicking threadlocker cures in 24 hours and can be removed with hand tools and, in rare instances, may require heat to assist when threads have excessive engagement lengths.





Looked up Threadlocker for stainless steel on their website



What is considered low curing time for activator?

-   Every loctite has a curing graph with activators
-   Assuming it needs an activator if the peak strength with no activator is less than with an activator

Not Primerless

Primerless
