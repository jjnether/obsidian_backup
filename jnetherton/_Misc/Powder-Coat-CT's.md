Goal to powder coat the whole CT (000 or A00 drawings attached) -- including big aluminum tube. Using insulating powder coat (not conductive)

 

TBD how many # of coats

TBD if will stick to tape/tube/glue/etc

TBD how will look in finished part

Can we send/show drawings?

How many do we want powder coated, and of which variation?

-   I assume some with 1 coat, some with 2, maybe 3?

Are we asking about cost?

Where to find material of tape/glue/tube/etc?
