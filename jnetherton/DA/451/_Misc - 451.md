QUESTIONS:
- There's always lockout active when there's external fault indication - do we want this?


- Need to double check logic for emergency transfer
	- emergency transfer is when we're on the alternate source, and we lose it, but the primary is back
	- should always be an OBC because we don't want to close into whatever caused us to lose the alternate
-   Protection logic
    -   Guaranteed to execute in 1/8th of a cycle
    -   2 ms update times
    -   Custom protection functions
-   Automation logic
    -   Not guaranteed
    -   (70-75 ms update time)

**Tips:**
- Can sorta use a sequencing timer as a conditioning timer by notting the IN value in the reset

Remove 51 timing and fault targeting
Remove single ph mech fail? - never used
Blocks operation based on FCI input, but we can just implement to use CT's instead of FCI
-   Use current for transfer block (analog rather than FCI's)
Nic - Eversource errors, discrepancies, DNP stuff?

Examples:
-   UofHouston - return transfer
-   DSM_freeport - stripped down ATC
-   UofOregon - no ATC, but 451 for protection (50P delay and 50G delay incorporated into protection logic


**Don't transfer on a fault** (on source 1 or 2)
- FCI's currently block transfer, and take it out of auto? (should it take it out of auto?)

**If RTS is CBO and you're timing for a return, but you lose the source you're on, it'll transfer immediately with CBO. In an emergency like this, it always needs to be OBC.**

**PPL - sync on CBO return transfer, logic moved to Automation, logic diagrams, test mode removed, removed ITS CBO**

Should we keep AST06/AST07? - hardcoded to provide a set buffer - if so, may need to specify in GWI?
Update AST06/AST07 comments - maybe should just be "s1 stable"
For Bob's ALT15R/ALT16R, should we include excess run, as it is originally?
Why have ACT12? - it just makes sure that uncommanded operation checks for no current operations, PLUS an additional 2 sec after those drop out


I think this is an actual logic issue, that's easy to fix if you are still working on the ATC revamp. Â The logic should take into consideration if it is in preferred source mode or non-preferred mode.
Current - PSV26 := (ASV202 AND F_TRIG PLT18) OR (ASV202 AND F_TRIG PLT19) # EXIT AUTO ON "NO RETURN SEQUENCE" VARIABLE
New - PSV26 := (ASV202 AND F_TRIG PLT18 AND ASV001) OR (ASV202 AND F_TRIG PLT19 AND ASV002) # EXIT AUTO ON "NO RETURN SEQUENCE" VARIABLE
OR
New - PSV26 := ASV003 and ((ASV202 AND F_TRIG PLT18) OR (ASV202 AND F_TRIG PLT19)) # EXIT AUTO ON "NO RETURN SEQUENCE" VARIABLE

Get feedback from Enio regarding new test mode with local bits (keep logic intact, but make it use actual logic instead of its own test logic)


- New GWI for this iteration
- All documentation will need to be reviewed after changes are finalized
- Update DNP maps
- Do we want Aliases?
	- Add to the GWI
- Guide spec?
	- describes ATC 451, as it's supposed to be used
	- customer copies and puts it in their own spec
	- let's us put our particulars in

ASV001 = S1 Preferred
ASV002 = S2 Preferred
ASV003 = Non-Preferred
ASV101 = SRC 1 52A
ASV102 = SRC 1 52B
ASV111 = SRC 2 52A
ASV112 = SRC 2 52B

NOT ASV141 AND (NOT ALT07 OR PCT12Q) AND ((NOT ALT02 AND ASV061) OR (ASV055 AND (R_TRIG PCT12Q AND ASV111 OR R_TRIG ASV222))) # SOURCE 2 OPEN
- not in lockout
- S1 not in ITS or OBW
- not in auto and
