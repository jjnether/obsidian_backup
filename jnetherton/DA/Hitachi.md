IEC 61850 - the big next step

No google

Tesla, Amazon, Meta, QTS Vantage,

RET 670 - google uses - wanted special feature as they were worried about if transformer is overloaded

Ring main units being implemented distribution side - not good?

Focus on datacenters, but universities are also great opportunity

We need to show why the REC670 is superior over the SEL relays

We're not structured well to handle all the beurocracy



+70C operating temperature - rated to +85C, but may degrade life of product - SEL doesn't talk about that

IEC 62443

IEC 62351 - authentication of data transfer

Next gen is 650

PCM 3.0 Hitachi Software (use on 670's, no 615's)

1 or 2 legos are 650, 4 is 670 (no 3 option)



Radios:

-   TRO610 (cellular only)
-   TRO620 - higher throughput
    -   Hybrid (mesh) capability
        -   Gives flexibility and resilience
-   TRO670
    -   Helper nodes and good for harsh environments (outdoor), otherwise go for 620



Goal is that we have a complete package with radios and plug and play



Business drivers:

-   Network control
-   One network, many applications



Private LTE is a big inflection point in the industry

-   Both devices support public and private LTE



DTE



Intelligent infrastructure monitoring

-   Remote monitoring
-   Remote inspection
-   Autonomous data collection
-   Autonomous monitoring
    -   Corona incoming?
    -   Thermal
    -   LiDar
