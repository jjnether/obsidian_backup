OSI Model
- 7 layers of networking
	- 1. Physical
	- 2. Datalink Layer
		- Introduces MAC (Medium Access Control) Address
			- 48 bit address given to each physical network interface
				- first 24 bits define the device's manufacturer (OUI)
				- last 24 bits are specific to the physical network interface
		- Devices that read MAC addresses and facilitate communications within the same subnet are "switches"
			- managed and unmanaged
