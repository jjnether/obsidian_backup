OSI Model
- 7 layers of networking
	- 1. Physical
	- 2. Datalink Layer
		- Introduces MAC (Medium Access Control) Address
			- 48 bit address given to each physical network interface
				- first 24 bits define the device's manufacturer (OUI)
				- last 24 bits are specific to the physical network interface
			- There are special MAC addresses reserved for specific applications:
				- True source is almost always true source, but you'll see GOOSE group as destination
				- GOOSE multicast
				- RSTD
		- Devices that read MAC addresses and facilitate communications within the same subnet are "switches"
			- managed and unmanaged
	- 3. Network Layer
		- This layer deals with inter network communication or end-to-end
		- Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
			- four octets
			- private addresses can range from:
				- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
				- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
				- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
