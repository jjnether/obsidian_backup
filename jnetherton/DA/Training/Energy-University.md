SCADA - Supervisory control and data acquisition

DMS - (advanced) distribution management system
-   Volt/VAR
    -   Controlled with voltage regulators, capacitor banks, and sensors (getting a feel for where the voltage is at)

FLISR
-   Biggest thing it does is partial restoration
-   Rarely both overhead and underground

CAIDI

SAIDI

SAIFI


Script based

-   Basically what is programmed into the relay
-   Static response to system events
-   Limited number of devices in the system
-   Automation can only be on or off
-   Userdefined and scripted
-   Can be closer to cycles
-   Limited support of advanced applications

Model based

-   Needs communication
-   Basically survalent
-   Adapts to what the system is doing
    -   Dynamic response to system events
-   Closer to seconds
-   Fully scalable
    -   Used for more than 15 devices
-   Includes semi-automatic mode
    -   Basically suggests things, but requires user input to execute
        -   Good for user learning
-   Full support for advanced applications
    -   Integration of DER (distributed energy resources)
    -   Conservation voltage reduction (CVR) & Volt/Var Control (VVC)
    -   Optimal Feeder reconfiguration (OFR)
    -   Load Shedding

Communication is not a must for FLISR

-   Non-communicating automation schemes
    -   Timer-based, limited number of contingencies and devices
    -   Zero communications, not even peer to peer

Decentralized could mean communication within the system


Microgrid



Considerations:

-   Vanadium Flow
-   Lithium Ion
-   Iron Flow
-   Zinc Bromine
