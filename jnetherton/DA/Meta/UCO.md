Transceiver left to right: hmi, comm a, comm b

---
WEEK OF 03/24

- pulled MIB 2 from 2EY1.MVS.B02 for MIB replacement
- replaced MIB 2 on 1EY1.MVS.A01 and test way 2 is operating properly
- verified motor operation on ways 1 and 2 for MCUP5 - can close this issue in their system
- checked comms on MCUP 2/3
    - peer to peer comms were good
    - MCUP2 had bad comms to the hmi, but wiring looked fine at the MVS - fixed by unplugging and replugging fiber into transceiver at the HMI
