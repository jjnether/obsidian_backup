Transceiver left to right: hmi, comm a, comm b

- pulled MIB 2 from 2EY1.MVS.B02 for MIB replacement
- replaced MIB 2 on 1EY1.MVS.A01 and test way 2 is operating properly
- verified motor operation on ways 1 and 2 for MCUP5 - can close this issue in their system
- checked comms on MCUP 2/3
    - peer to peer comms were good
    - MCUP2 had bad comms to the hmi, but wiring looked fine at the MVS - fixed by unplugging and replugging fiber into transceiver at the HMI

Peer to peer comms testing:
- MCUP 6/7
- MCUP 4/5
- MCUP 2/3
- MCUP 1/IWM

HMI comm testing:
- MCUP7
- MCUP6
- MCUP5
- MCUP4
- MCUP3
- MCUP2
- MCUP1
- IWM

PTX testing:
- All MCUPs already completed PTX testing

Completed L3 testing:
- MCUP1/IWM
