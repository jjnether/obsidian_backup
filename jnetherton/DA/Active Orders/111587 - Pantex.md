All you would need to do is change the port IP's on the RTAC through the web HMI using the USB-B port. Attached is the guide Matt had previously shared for this simple process. The RJ45 port is Eth_01, so I believe you'll need to change that IP/subnet/gateway to the desired values (may also want to enable ping while on that page). You'll then want to change the fiber port previously used (Eth_02) to some other IP or subnet as it won't be in use.
