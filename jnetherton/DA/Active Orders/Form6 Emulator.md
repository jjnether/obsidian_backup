72513 - midwest - GWI - 32 pin template


Changed:
- Added logic so all 3 phases are always selected when in single ph enable - 3 ph trip mode
- LT5 (previously PB lock when low) removed from CL3P and ULCL equations
- Removed `NOT (CLOSEA OR (CC3 OR CCA) AND LT03 OR 79CYA)` term from all ULCL equations
	- isn't necessary and was blocking close sometimes
- Changed single-ph close equations so user can close all 3 phases when in 1ph trip-3ph lockout mode
- Changed TR3P equation so a PB press open only opens all 3 phases if in 3ph lockout or 3ph trip mode
- Removed MV18 (operating mode) supervisory from SV42 (PB trip conditions)
- Changed 79DTL3P so it does 3ph lockout upon pushbutton trip only in 3ph lockout or 3ph trip mode
- Added to 79DTLA/B/C so it locks out upon PB press and the respective phase selected
- Added SV19 for indicating 3ph trip, 3ph LO, or 1ph selected on panel
	- Added SV19 to LT21 (close PB latch)
- Added SV44 and SV45 variables for indicating if selected ph is closed or open (supervises PB close/open latches)
	- Added SV44 and SV45 to LT21 and LT22 (open/close PB latches)
- Added LT06 (HLT) to LT21 (close PB latch) so latch won't set when HLT is enabled
- Added "NO AC PRESENT" display point
- Added original open/close LED logic to open/close external LED's
	- Also changed so there is alternate blinking when SPO=1
- Changed A/B/C Fault TLED's to the overcurrent logic from the TRIPA/B/C equations
	- This was because the previous values used were PHASE_A/B/C, but these assert anytime TRIPA/B/C asserts, so they were asserting when opening via PB when in 1ph mode


Questions
- Should we define a default DNP map? Maybe just use what we have for the 32-pin template?
- Add cold load pickup for when closing via PB and phase is locked out?
- Only one function can be changed per change mode activation?
	- I think this isn't necessary?
- When yellow handle is pulled on one phase, it trips all 3 if 3ph LO, but only trips the one if in 1ph LO
	- should we add this?
- Protection profiles? I assume probably not
-  If the the control shuts down due to low battery voltage before AC power is restored, and the connected energized recloser is CLOSED, it will only TRIP and LOCKOUT via front panel pushbutton command.
	- can we do this?
- Lockout LED (only one) is green on Form6, should we change ours to green? Also, it blinks when in 1ph-1LO mode and 1/2 phases are in lockout, but not all 3. Maybe implement if a phase is locked out, but not all 3 are, the locked out phases blink?
- In the event of main microprocessor failure, the trip circuit can operate independent of the main microprocessor
	- can we do this?
- For HLT, there's a multiple different behaviors for F6:
	- HLT opens all 3 phases independent mode or timing that defines the trip time. If any one phase is already open and HLT is activate the other 2 phases will **NOT**  open.
	- HLT opens all 3 phases independent mode or timing that defines the trip time. If any one phase is already open and HLT is activate the other 2 phases will immediately open.
	- specific curve allowed to be programmed for HLT?
	- form 6 allowed activation from other sources, but only allowed deactivation when all sources are disabled
		- may only be reset by the source that set it (if activated at the operator panel, must be deactivated there, and not by SCADA)
	- Add definite time delay for HLT elements?
	- HLT will act on whatever is fastest, active curve or time delay
	- If above ground pickup and below phase trips all 3 phases on TCC1 or HLT definite time delay?
- Use spare PB's for ALT2/3?
- Is there a possibility for 52A/B discrepancy?

Test Plan:
- Do a compare with the 32-pin template and test any changed functionality
- test basic but frequently used functions


MEETING NOTES:
- Differences:
	- HLT - initiate trip based on HLT activating - should not cause a trip
- Blinking LED's when only one phase open
- design template should exactly match simplified setup

Missing Features:
- Can't have phase LED blink

Missing LED's
- No AC present (add display point)
- RAM failure
- ROM failure
- Power Supply Malf
- RIF Comm Failure
- Alarm
- Above minimum trip

TO CHECK:
- HLT takes precedence over CLPU
- Lockout is enabled for a bit on all 3 phases when just opening one phase

# FUNCTIONALITY

### HOT LINE TAG
- All closing is disabled
- one trip-to-lockout
- takes precedence over cold load pickup, non-reclosing, and fast trips disabled
- can be activated only from toggle switch
	- 

### COLD LOAD PICKUP
- Phase and ground CLPU can be enabled in the template
- CLPU doesn't latch until loss of diversity timer times out
	- Aph loss of diversity -> (Aph is in LO, 3ph LO, or reclosing defeated) AND SPOA AND phase or ground CLPU enabled (template set pickup)
	- Ground latches if any phase loss of diversity latches and ground CLPU is enabled
	- CLPU latches reset via natural or forced restoration
		- Natural -> current below set threshold and Aph closed (15sec pickup)
		- Forced -> setting enabled and Aph closed (template set pickup)
