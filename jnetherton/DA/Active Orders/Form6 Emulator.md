Problems between program and documentation
- A,B,C select PB's aren't all active when in 1ph trip-3ph lockout mode (documentation says they should be)
	- In this mode, you can also only close one phase at a time (documentation says this should only happen when in 1ph trip-1ph lockout)

72513 - midwest - GWI - 32 pin template



To add?
- Alt profile #2, alt profile #3? - we have 3 spare PB's
- no close circuit disable fuse to remove
- only one function changed per change mode activation?
- Add phase/gnd cold load pickup display points for indication?


Operation:
- On our 32-pin template, if in operating mode 2 (1ph lockout, but 3ph lockout for multiph fault) or 3 (3ph lockout), 


to test:
- lockout modes
- pushbutton double press modes
