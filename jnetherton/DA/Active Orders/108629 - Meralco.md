- POD - 78209
- S1 and S2 always closed and paralleled - close transition
- RCPMSG
	- remote controllable pad mount switchgear
- Make sure production has the latest revision files
- F-00238 - ATC production test

- For DNP testing, make sure relay and RTAC time are synced
	- Relay will request time from RTAC
- MAKE SURE ANY SETTINGS EDITS ALSO GET UPDATED IN PRODUCTION FOLDERS
- 19920V Nominal (L-G)
	- 34.5 kV L-L


Relays:
- A13413579ADF (700G)
- A13413591HD0 (451)

NOTES:
- For testing SF6, pull IN107 (451)

QUESTIONS:
- SCADA aliases?
- Is it ok that DNP maps match even though one is 3 way, so it has points for a way that doesn't exist?
- will power supply automatically run battery test upon startup, or does relay need logic for that to happen?
- FAT said to set batt test to every hour and verify with SER?
	- Can't set to 1 hour in template, and do we even need this? (removed for now)
- How to simulate hardware alarm?
- 451 analog inputs for current are showing at actual value (4000 A) while the 700G shows it at x100 - this ok?



TO TEST:
- Insert 220VAC through circuit breaker and show it powers up
	- Also verify 24 VDC out for telecoms
- Demonstrate switch mode for 700G
- 700G check 51P overcurrent fault indication
- Check Fault current analog input for 451 (seemed scaled too high)
- remove redundant SF6 DNP point?

- Check Fault current analog input on 451
- send scanned FAT to engelbert


MEETING:
- 7 units - 6 installed (5 online, one had flashover)

- Values reported for voltage were in kV (forced scaling to 1.0)
	- Changed scaling forced to 100, so user can see kV with 2 decimals
- The pickup values are SETTINGS. These settings are input as secondary values. When sent over DNP, they are scaled by 1000. Note that if 50 settings are disabled, they get set to 100. This means the sent DNP value will overflow, showing 32767
- Tested remote target reset - works
- Tested binary inputs for 51P/51G - THEY DO NOT LATCH

351R4 - Changes

Agenda:
- Technical Discussion
	- Meralco Applications of RC switchgear
	- Roles and responsibilities
	- Introduction to RC switchgear
	- Components
	- Installation Procedure
	- Operation
	- Maintenance activities
	- Q&A
- Switchgear hands-on operation
	- Visual and labels inspection
	- Operation (switching)
	- Decoupling of motor (optional)
	- Installation procedure â€“ before and after inspection
		- How to lift switch properly with lifting point
			- balanced
		- CT installation - CT is already attached
		- How to install elbow properly - leave to elbow manufacturer
		- high pot for switch then separate high pot for elbows
- Testing
	- Visual inspection
	- Electrical tests
		- Hi-pot
			- 50kV for one min with PT primary disconnected
		- Current Resistance
			- Circuit resistance measurements should be less than 500 micro-ohms between adjacent ways, and there should not be a variance of more than 100 micro-ohms between phases on the same way.
		- Fault simulation
		- Primary injection also
	- Relay testing
		- Testing following FAT procedure? Or something else?
	- SCADA testing
- Protection Settings
	- Control and relay navigation
	- Updating of relay settings (manually and thru laptop)
	- TCC Curves
	- Downloading of events

CHANGES
- HALARM - 451 - changed to normal state 0
- 700G TLED's for OC - assert even when no trip


LT08 through LT13 - 700G - not used?
UPDATE DNP EXCEL MAP - SCALING
only have CB01 or CB04 active at a time, not both
send steps for hi-pot from factory
ASV124/125 - S1/S2 BLOCK - NOTHING WIRED TO IN201/IN202 - SHOULD REMOVE FROM DNP MAP (BI_14/23)
ASV122/123 - S1/S2 FCI - NOT USED (IN215/IN216)
700GW - left labels need to be blank
wrong column for nameplate kA ratings?
Check on how they should handle bushings during hi-pot?
Setup for capacitive voltage was S1 closed and S2 closed, then they opened S2 (it's now floating) - he shocked himself on floating S2
- They try to ground the tbody, but then they can't remove it - they also can't isolate the switch
700 FIRMWARE UPDATE? - 4 units?
Send instruction manuals for 451 and 700G
when batt test is running, if AC is lost, can it still switch to batteries?
