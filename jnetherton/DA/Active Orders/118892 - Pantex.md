## 108057 - Loss of Comms issue
- saw loss of comms on both 751 relays, not on 451 relay
	- most likely due to serial cables being swapped
- Verified SEL protocol was communicating properly between 751 relays and RTAC
	- most likely, the cables were swapped, but they were still communicating, so only the heartbeat logic isn't working (this is intended for this scenario)
- misunderstood issue, so removed loss of comms display point from 751 as directed by Steve

Next steps:
- Need to verify that cables are swapped
	- Ask steve when he gets upstream comms
