Original MOT - 0651RA01XAAAAF1A3311XADX
New MOT - 0651R22CXAAAAF1113D6XX

PN - D8760SS2LB00

FYI:
- Regarding EZ Settings, all those settings can be found in the 32-pin template for the 651R2, so the user shouldn't have a problem finding what he needs.

- Only kept DNP points that customer originally had (didn't add any)
- Added Battery test logic
- RA has logic so it won't close back in until 81D4T is de-asserted (only purpose for 81D4) - should this be added?
	- R2 is hard set to 1x 81 element
	- enable in the template, supervise close equation
- Added pushbutton for battery test

Notes:
- no 50G3 element
- Single phasing trip (kept original logic)
- Identical DNP map
	- map is for 3 phase operation
- Transferred overcurrent and reclose settings
- Transferred communication settings
- Capability of sync check, but it's not implemented in the logic (they didn't use it in their program)
